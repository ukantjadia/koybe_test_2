# Phase 1 Implementation
### TODO:
## Environment Setup
- Choose Tech Stack
- Initialize Git repo
- CI/CD Skeleton
- Provision hosting
- Project Structures

## Lead Ingestion
- Create web form
- CSV parser & upload
- Field mapping
- Backend ingestion route

## Web Form & Database Feature

A new feature has been added to provide manual lead entry through a web form interface with database storage.

### Components:

1. **Web Form (Frontend just only for Testing)**
   - Simple form to collect lead information (name, email, phone, company)
   - HTML templates with CSS styling for clean UI
   - Form validation for required fields

2. **CSV Upload Feature**
   - Upload leads in bulk via CSV files
   - Field mapping for CSV columns
   - Data validation and cleaning
   - Duplicate detection
   - Support for all lead fields:
     - Basic contact info (name, email, phone)
     - Company details (name, website, industry)
     - Location (city, state)
     - Additional fields (title, business type, notes)

3. **Database Connection (Backend)**
   - PostgreSQL database for storing lead information
   - Flask-SQLAlchemy integration for ORM functionality
   - Data model for leads with appropriate fields

4. **Data Viewing**
   - Page to view all submitted leads in a table format
   - Quick verification of stored information
   - Edit and delete functionality

### File Structure:
```
/backend
  /models
    lead_model.py    # Database model for Lead
  /controllers
    lead_controller.py  # Business logic for lead operations
    upload_controller.py # CSV upload processing
  /routes
    lead_routes.py   # API routes for lead operations
  /templates
    form.html        # Form for submitting leads
    upload.html      # CSV upload interface
    leads.html       # View for displaying stored leads
  /config
    config.py        # Configuration settings
  app.py            # Main Flask application
  wsgi.py           # WSGI entry point
```

### Data Flow:
1. User submits form with lead information or uploads CSV file
2. Backend validates and processes form data
3. Lead data is stored in PostgreSQL database
4. User can view all submitted leads

This feature complements the automated lead generation capabilities by allowing manual entry of leads from other sources.

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PostgreSQL database
- pandas (for CSV processing)

### Database Setup
1. Create a PostgreSQL database named `lead_db`:
   ```
   createdb lead_db
   ```
2. Update the database connection string in `backend/config/config.py` if needed:
   ```python
   SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://username@localhost:5432/lead_db'
   ```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd LeadGenAI
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   pip install pandas==1.3.3
   ```

### Running the Application
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Run the Flask application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

### Docker Deployment
The application can be deployed using Docker:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t leadgen-app .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```
   docker run -p 8000:8000 leadgen-app
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### CSV Upload Format
The CSV file should contain the following columns (column names can be mapped during upload):
- Name (required)
- Email (required)
- Phone (required)
- Company
- Website
- City
- State
- Title
- Industry
- Business Type
- Notes
